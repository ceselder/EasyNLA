RL rollout (train_rl_vllm.rollout_batch_vllm) and the offline AV decoder used by

The injection is a `vllm_lens.SteeringVector` applied at `injection_layer` (=1)
with `norm_match=True`: the activation is renormalized to the running residual
norm and ADDed at the marker position — the exact Karvonen formula
`h'_p = h_p + ||h_p|| · v/||v||` the AV was trained with. Requires the
vllm-lens norm-match patch (utils/patch_vllm_lens.py).
